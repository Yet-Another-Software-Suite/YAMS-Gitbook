# Heading and aim modes

A [`SwerveInputStream`](swerve-input-stream.md) normally turns the robot at the rate the rotation stick asks for. This page covers the other ways it can turn the robot: facing a heading, aiming at a target, and holding the heading while it drives. Build the stream first, as [Building a stream](swerve-input-stream.md#building-a-stream) shows.

In the examples, `input` is your stream and `driverController` is the `CommandGamepad` from the [Swerve Drive tutorial](../tutorials/swerve-drive.md). Its buttons are `Trigger`s, which can be passed wherever a `BooleanSupplier` is expected. The methods are the same in Commands v2 and Commands v3, and C++ has each one in PascalCase.

## Modes are chosen automatically

A stream is always in exactly one of four internal modes: `ANGULAR_VELOCITY` (the default), `TRANSLATION_ONLY`, `HEADING`, or `AIM`. You never select a mode directly. `get()` re-derives it on every call from which optional pieces are configured and whether the relevant `BooleanSupplier` trigger currently reports true, then transitions cleanly (resetting the relevant PID controllers) if the mode changed since the last call. Mode priority, highest to lowest: `TRANSLATION_ONLY` > `AIM` > `HEADING` > `ANGULAR_VELOCITY`. `getCurrentModeName()` returns the mode the last `get()` used.

`HEADING`, `AIM` and `TRANSLATION_ONLY` turn the robot with the rotation controller from `SwerveDriveConfig.withRotationController(...)`, so configure one before using them.

{% hint style="info" %}
`SwerveInputStream` used to have a `DRIVE_TO_POSE` mode and a matching `atTargetPose(...)` method; both have been removed. Use [`SwerveDrive.driveToPose(...)`](swerve-drive.md#auto-align) for auto-align instead.
{% endhint %}

## Heading-snap control

### `withHeadingControl`

`withHeadingControl(trigger)` enables `HEADING` while `trigger` reports true, snapping to a heading derived from [`withControllerHeadingAxis(x, y)`](swerve-input-stream.md#withcontrollerheadingaxis) instead of rotating at a velocity. The robot stops turning while the heading stick is inside the deadband.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/sis-heading.gif" alt="Animation of the right stick moving in an arc around its edge, from straight up round to the left, back through the top and round to the right. The robot turns with it, always facing the direction the stick points, a moment behind"><figcaption><p><code>HEADING</code> mode: as the right stick moves around, the robot turns to face where it points.</p></figcaption></figure>

```java
SwerveInputStream headingStream = input.clone()
    .withControllerHeadingAxis(() -> -driverController.getRightX(), () -> -driverController.getRightY())
    .withHeadingControl(driverController.faceDown());
```

### `withHeading`

`withHeading(Supplier<Angle>)` faces a field-relative heading from code instead of a stick, and replaces any controller heading axes.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/sis-with-heading.gif" alt="Animation of a robot facing away from the driver station with both sticks at rest. While the A button is held the robot turns to face 90 degrees and holds it"><figcaption><p>A heading from code, enabled while A is held.</p></figcaption></figure>

```java
input.withHeading(() -> Degrees.of(90))
     .withHeadingControl(driverController.faceDown());
```

## Aim at a target

`withAim(Supplier<Pose2d> targetPose, BooleanSupplier trigger)` enables `AIM` while `trigger` reports true, rotating to face `targetPose` while translation keeps working normally. See [Mutations apply immediately](swerve-input-stream.md#mutations-apply-immediately) for an example that retargets it live.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/sis-aim.gif" alt="Animation of a robot driven left and right by the left stick while it stays facing a target on the field"><figcaption><p><code>AIM</code> mode: the left stick drives, the robot keeps facing the target.</p></figcaption></figure>

```java
// The target on the field. Use your game's real position.
Pose2d speakerPose = new Pose2d(Meters.of(0.2), Meters.of(5.5), Rotation2d.ZERO);
input.withAim(() -> speakerPose, driverController.rightBumper());
```

`withAim` points the front of the robot at the pose it is given. The options below refine that. They are the same in Commands v2 and Commands v3, and C++ has each one in PascalCase.

{% hint style="info" %}
Aiming at a target is not the same as shooting on the move. The stream turns the robot, and it knows nothing about your shooter or how long a shot is in the air. [How do I shoot on the move?](../how-to/how-do-i-shoot-on-the-move.md) explains what these options cover and what you still have to work out yourself.
{% endhint %}

### Aim lookahead

`withAimLookahead(Time)` aims from where the robot will be after a delay, instead of where it is now. The pose is moved along the robot's field relative velocity by that time before the direction to the target is worked out.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/sis-aim-lookahead.gif" alt="Animation of a robot driving to the right with a faded copy of itself a short way ahead along its velocity. A grey dashed line runs from the robot to the target, and an orange dashed line runs from the faded copy to the target. The robot turns to the direction of the orange line."><figcaption><p>The robot turns to the direction it will need a moment from now.</p></figcaption></figure>

A game piece leaves the robot a moment after the aim was calculated: the camera, the loop, the motors and the feed all take time, and the robot keeps moving through all of it. Add those delays together for a starting value, then tune it. It is often 100 to 200 milliseconds.

```java
input.withAimLookahead(Milliseconds.of(150));
```

The lookahead assumes the robot keeps its current velocity, so it works best while driving in a straight line.

### Aim feedforward

`withAimFeedforward(SimpleMotorFeedforward)` adds a feedforward to the aim rotation. The rotation controller only reacts to heading error, so while the robot drives past a target it trails a little behind. The feedforward is calculated from the robot's current angular velocity to the angular velocity the controller asks for, and its result is added to that angular velocity.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/sis-aim-feedforward.gif" alt="Animation of two robots driving back and forth past a target. A grey dashed line shows the direction to the target and an orange arrow shows where each robot faces. The robot with only the rotation controller trails the target by about 20 degrees as it passes in front of it. The robot with an aim feedforward trails by about 9 degrees."><figcaption><p>The lag is largest as the robot passes in front of the target. A feedforward shrinks it.</p></figcaption></figure>

```java
input.withAimFeedforward(new SimpleMotorFeedforward(0, 0.1));
```

**How to use it:** hold the aim button and drive sideways past the target while you watch the heading, or [`aimLock`](#aim-lock). With telemetry at `MID` or above, graph the [rotation controller's measurement against its setpoint](swerve-input-stream-telemetry.md#rotation-controller-inputs) to see the lag. If the robot trails the target, start with a small `kV` and raise it until it keeps up. Too much makes the heading overshoot and wobble. `kS` and `kA` can usually stay at 0.

The feedforward does not remove the lag completely, and it is no substitute for a rotation controller that is tuned well. Tune the controller in [`SwerveDriveConfig`](mechanism-configs/swerve-drive-config.md) first.

### Aim heading offset

`withAimHeadingOffset(Rotation2d)` rotates the aim heading, for a shooter that does not point out of the front of the robot. The offset is counter-clockwise positive. `withAimHeadingOffset(Rotation2d, BooleanSupplier)` only applies it while the supplier is true.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/sis-aim-heading-offset.gif" alt="Animation of two robots driving left and right in front of a target. Each has a shooter on its back, drawn in orange. With no offset the front of the robot faces the target and the shooter faces away from it. With an offset of 180 degrees the robot is turned around, so the shooter faces the target."><figcaption><p><code>withAim</code> points the front of the robot at the target. The offset turns the side with the shooter to it instead.</p></figcaption></figure>

```java
// The shooter points out of the back of the robot.
input.withAimHeadingOffset(Rotation2d.fromDegrees(180));
```

**How to use it:** the offset is the angle from the front of the robot to the direction the shooter points, counter-clockwise positive. A shooter out of the back is 180 degrees, out of the left side is 90 degrees, and out of the right side is -90 degrees. A small offset, such as 2 degrees, also works as a trim for a shooter that throws slightly to one side.

The version with a `BooleanSupplier` lets one stream serve two mechanisms: aim the front at a target for an intake, and turn the offset on while a shooter on the back is in use.

### Aim lock

`aimLock(Angle)` returns a `Trigger` that is true while the robot is aiming and its heading is within the tolerance of the aim heading. `isAimLocked(Angle)` gives the same answer as a plain `boolean`. Use them to decide when to feed a game piece.

```java
Trigger aimed = input.aimLock(Degrees.of(2));
```

The lock only updates while the stream is being read, and it is false whenever aiming is not enabled. C++ has `IsAimLocked(tolerance)` and no trigger version.

### Building your own aim

Two methods expose the pieces the aim mode is made of:

| Method                            | Returns                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `getTargetVector(Pose2d)`         | The field relative vector from the robot to a target, from the looked ahead position if a lookahead is set.   |
| `calculateAngularVelocity(Angle)` | The angular velocity that turns the robot to a heading, from the rotation controller and the aim feedforward. |

## Translation only

`withTranslationOnly(trigger)` enables `TRANSLATION_ONLY` while `trigger` reports true, locking the current heading and suppressing rotation entirely:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/sis-translation-only.gif" alt="Animation of a robot driving across the field while the right stick is wiggled. The robot&#x27;s heading stays at 30 degrees the whole time"><figcaption><p><code>TRANSLATION_ONLY</code> mode: the right stick is ignored and the heading is held.</p></figcaption></figure>

```java
input.withTranslationOnly(driverController.leftStick()); // while the left stick is pressed in
```
