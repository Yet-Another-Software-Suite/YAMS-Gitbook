# ArmConfig

An arm is a mechanism that swings about a pivot and has to hold itself up against gravity. The [Arms](../arms.md) page shows a complete arm.

`ArmConfig` has the [shared options](shared-options.md) and one of its own.

## `withLength`

The length of the arm, from the pivot to its end.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/mech-arm.png" alt="An arm drawn at 40 degrees above a level dashed line marked 0 degrees, with straight up marked 90 degrees. Its length, set by withLength, runs from the pivot to the end of the arm, and gravity pulls down on the end. Level is zero because gravity pulls hardest on a level arm and ArmFeedforward uses kG times the cosine of the angle."><figcaption><p>An arm's angle is measured from level, and its length sets how hard it is to move.</p></figcaption></figure>

```java
new ArmConfig().withLength(Feet.of(3));
```

The simulation uses the length for its physics and for the drawing. A longer arm is harder to hold and to swing, so retune the gains if the length changes.

**Used in:** simulation only. **Required** for an `Arm` to be created in simulation.

## Zero is level

Angles on an `Arm` are measured from level: 0° is parallel to the ground and 90° is straight up. That is what [`ArmFeedforward`](../editor/config/feedforward.md#withfeedforward) expects, and it is why an arm's encoder must read 0 when the arm is level.

* With an absolute encoder, set its [zero offset](../editor/config/encoders.md#withexternalencoderzerooffset) so it reads 0 when the arm is level.
* Without one, set a [starting position](../editor/config/encoders.md#withstartingposition) and always turn the robot on with the arm there.
