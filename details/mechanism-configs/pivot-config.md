# PivotConfig

A pivot is a rotating mechanism such as a turret or a wrist. It is different from an arm because it does not account for gravity. The [Turrets/Wrists](../turrets-wrists.md) page shows a complete pivot.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/mech-pivot-vs-arm.png" alt="Two panels. An Arm accounts for gravity: it swings up and down, needs kG to hold and uses ArmFeedforward. A Pivot does not account for gravity: it is for a vertical axis or a balanced wrist, has no kG and uses SimpleMotorFeedforward."><figcaption><p>An Arm accounts for gravity. A Pivot does not.</p></figcaption></figure>

`PivotConfig` has only the [shared options](shared-options.md): telemetry, hard limits, color and position. Everything else about a pivot is on its motor config.

```java
new PivotConfig()
    .withHardLimits(Degrees.of(-200), Degrees.of(200)) // wiring stops it spinning forever
    .withTelemetry("Turret", TelemetryVerbosity.HIGH);
```

## What else a pivot needs

| For                                      | Use                                                                                                                                |

| The physical stops                       | [`withHardLimits`](shared-options.md#withhardlimits). **Required** in simulation.                                                  |
| A turret that can spin all the way round | [`withContinuousWrapping`](../editor/config/closed-loop-control.md#withcontinuouswrapping) on the motor config, and no soft limits |
| A turret limited by its wiring           | [`withSoftLimits`](../editor/config/limits-and-protection.md#withsoftlimits) on the motor config                                   |
| The pivot's weight in simulation         | [`withMomentOfInertia`](../editor/config/simulation.md#withmomentofinertia) on the motor config                                    |
| Feedforward                              | [`SimpleMotorFeedforward`](../editor/config/feedforward.md#withfeedforward): a pivot has no `kG`                                   |
| A turret geared to turn more than once   | [EasyCRT](../easycrt.md)                                                                                                           |
