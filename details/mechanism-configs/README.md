# Mechanism configs

Every mechanism is built from two configs: a mechanism config that says what the mechanism is, and a [`SmartMotorControllerConfig`](../editor/config/README.md) that says how its motor behaves.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/mech-two-configs.png" alt="A diagram. A mechanism config, which says what the mechanism is, such as its length, mass, hard stops and how it is drawn, and a SmartMotorControllerConfig, which says how its motor behaves, such as gearing, PID, feedforward, soft limits and current, both go into the mechanism class. The mechanism then drives the simulation's physics and Mechanism2d, and the real robot's commands and telemetry."><figcaption><p>Two configs go into one mechanism.</p></figcaption></figure>

```java
SmartMotorController motor  = new SparkWrapper(spark, DCMotor.getNEO(1), motorConfig); // how the motor behaves
ArmConfig            config = new ArmConfig()                                          // what the arm is
    .withLength(Feet.of(3))
    .withHardLimits(Degrees.of(-30), Degrees.of(110))
    .withTelemetry("Arm", TelemetryVerbosity.HIGH);
Arm arm = new Arm(config, motor);
```

## The pages

| Page | Config | For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Shared options](shared-options.md) | all four below | Telemetry, hard limits, and how the mechanism is drawn. |
| [ArmConfig](arm-config.md) | `ArmConfig` | Arms that swing against gravity. |
| [ElevatorConfig](elevator-config.md) | `ElevatorConfig` | Elevators and linear slides. |
| [PivotConfig](pivot-config.md) | `PivotConfig` | Turrets and wrists. A pivot does not account for gravity. |
| [FlyWheelConfig](flywheel-config.md) | `FlyWheelConfig` | Shooters, rollers, intakes and anything else that spins. |
| [SwerveDriveConfig](swerve-drive-config.md) | `SwerveDriveConfig` | The whole swerve drive base. |
| [SwerveModuleConfig](swerve-module-config.md) | `SwerveModuleConfig` | One swerve module. |

## Which options each config has

| Option | Arm | Elevator | Pivot | FlyWheel |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`withTelemetry`](shared-options.md#withtelemetry) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| [`withSimColor`](shared-options.md#withsimcolor) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| [`withMechanismPositionConfig`](shared-options.md#withmechanismpositionconfig) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| [`withHardLimits`](shared-options.md#withhardlimits) | ✅ angles | ✅ distances | ✅ angles | ❌ |
| [`withLength`](arm-config.md#withlength) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| [`withCarriageWeight`](elevator-config.md#withcarriageweight) | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| [`withAngle`](elevator-config.md#withangle), [`withHorizontalElevator`](elevator-config.md#withhorizontalelevator) | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| [`withDiameter`](flywheel-config.md#withdiameter) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| [`withSpeedometerSimulation`](flywheel-config.md#withspeedometersimulation) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

The swerve configs are different enough to have their own pages and their own option lists.

## What simulation needs

{% hint style="warning" %}
Most mechanism config options describe the mechanism to the simulator and do nothing on the real robot. Some of them are **required** in simulation: the mechanism throws when it is created in simulation if they are missing. The exception is the mechanism's own, such as an `ArmConfigurationException` or a `PivotConfigurationException`, or a `SmartMotorControllerConfigurationException` when the missing option belongs to the motor config, such as an elevator's starting height. Each option page says where the option is used.
{% endhint %}

| Mechanism | Must be set for simulation to start |
| --- | --- |
| `Arm` | [`withLength`](arm-config.md#withlength), [`withHardLimits`](shared-options.md#withhardlimits), and a [starting position](../editor/config/encoders.md#withstartingposition) inside the hard limits. |
| `Elevator` | [`withCarriageWeight`](elevator-config.md#withcarriageweight), [`withHardLimits`](shared-options.md#withhardlimits), a [circumference](../editor/config/gearing-and-units.md#withmechanismcircumference), and a [starting position](../editor/config/encoders.md#withstartingposition) inside the hard limits. |
| `Pivot` | [`withHardLimits`](shared-options.md#withhardlimits), and a [starting position](../editor/config/encoders.md#withstartingposition) inside the hard limits. |
| `FlyWheel` | Nothing on the mechanism config. Its moment of inertia comes from the [motor config](../editor/config/simulation.md#withmomentofinertia). |

## Options that live on the motor config

Several things you might look for on a mechanism config are on the motor's config, because they change what the motor controller does:

| Looking for | It is |
| --- | --- |
| Soft limits | [`withSoftLimits`](../editor/config/limits-and-protection.md#withsoftlimits) |
| Where the mechanism starts | [`withStartingPosition`](../editor/config/encoders.md#withstartingposition) |
| Gear ratio, drum or wheel size | [Gearing and units](../editor/config/gearing-and-units.md) |
| Gains, feedforward, motion profile | [Closed loop control](../editor/config/closed-loop-control.md), [Feedforward](../editor/config/feedforward.md), [Motion profiles](../editor/config/motion-profiles.md) |
| Mass or moment of inertia of an arm, pivot or flywheel | [`withMomentOfInertia`](../editor/config/simulation.md#withmomentofinertia) |
| An absolute encoder | [Encoders](../editor/config/encoders.md) |
