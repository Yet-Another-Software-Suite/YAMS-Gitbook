# Log replay

In [log replay](https://docs.advantagekit.org/getting-started/what-is-advantagekit), AdvantageKit reads the inputs from a log file instead of from the hardware, and runs your code on them again. This is the **one case** where you need a separate IO implementation: an empty one that does nothing.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/akit-loop-live-and-replay.gif" alt="Animation of one loop of the robot shown twice. On the real robot and in simulation, the IO class reads the YAMS arm into the inputs, the inputs are written to the log, the subsystem logic runs on them, and its setpoint goes back through the IO class to the YAMS arm. In log replay the inputs come from the log file, the same subsystem logic runs on them, and the outputs go to an empty replay IO class that drops them."><figcaption><p>In replay the inputs come from the log, and the empty IO class drops the outputs.</p></figcaption></figure>

{% step %}
### Add the replay IO class

Create `ArmIOReplay.java` in the same `akit` folder as `ArmIO.java`. Every `ArmIO` method has an empty default, so the class is empty:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Java, Commands v2" %}
```java
package first.robot.subsystems.akit;

/**
 * Empty IO implementation for log replay.
 * AdvantageKit fills the inputs from the log, so there is no hardware to talk to.
 */
public class ArmIOReplay implements ArmIO {
  // Every method uses the empty default from ArmIO
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Java, Commands v3" %}
```java
package first.robot.mechanisms.akit;

/**
 * Empty IO implementation for log replay.
 * AdvantageKit fills the inputs from the log, so there is no hardware to talk to.
 */
public class ArmIOReplay implements ArmIO {
  // Every method uses the empty default from ArmIO
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**Check:** the project builds.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Use it in replay mode

Only replay mode needs a different IO class. `Robot.currentMode` comes from [Make Robot a logged robot](setup.md#make-robot-a-logged-robot).

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Java, Commands v2" %}
In `RobotContainer.java`, replace the line that creates the arm:

```java
  // Replay mode: the empty IO class, AdvantageKit fills the inputs from the log.
  // Real AND sim: the same IO class works for both.
  private final ArmSubsystem arm = new ArmSubsystem(
      Robot.currentMode == Robot.Mode.REPLAY ? subsystem -> new ArmIOReplay() : ArmIOTalonFX::new);
```

and add `import first.robot.subsystems.akit.ArmIOReplay;` to its imports.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Java, Commands v3" %}
In the `Robot` constructor, replace the line that creates the arm:

```java
    // Replay mode: the empty IO class, AdvantageKit fills the inputs from the log.
    // Real AND sim: the same IO class works for both.
    arm = new ArmMechanism(
        currentMode == Mode.REPLAY ? mechanism -> new ArmIOReplay() : ArmIOTalonFX::new);
```

and add `import first.robot.mechanisms.akit.ArmIOReplay;` to its imports.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**Check:** the project builds, and the simulation runs as before: `simMode` is still `Mode.SIM`.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Get a log to replay

On the robot, `Robot` already writes a log file every time the code runs. Download it with AdvantageScope's **File > Download Logs**.

No robot yet? Record a log in simulation. Add a `WPILOGWriter` to the `SIM` case in `Robot`:

```java
      case SIM:
        // In simulation: publish to NetworkTables, and write a log file to the project's logs folder.
        Logger.addDataReceiver(new NT4Publisher());
        Logger.addDataReceiver(new WPILOGWriter());
        break;
```

Run the simulation, move the arm as in [Step 4](subsystem-and-robotcontainer.md#step-4-wire-it-up), then stop the simulation.

**Check:** a file named like `akit_26-11-10_11-05-49.wpilog` is in the `logs` folder of your project.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Replay it

1. Open the log in AdvantageScope (**File > Open Log(s)**). `LogFileUtil.findReplayLog()` replays the log open in AdvantageScope.
2. In `Robot`, set `simMode` to `Mode.REPLAY`.
3. Run the simulation. It runs as fast as it can, and stops at the end of the log.

AdvantageKit writes the replayed values to a new log next to the one you replayed, with `_sim` at the end of its name, and opens it in AdvantageScope.

**Check:** open both logs. `Arm/PositionRotations` is the same in both.

When you are done, set `simMode` back to `Mode.SIM`.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## If it did not work

* **The simulation stops and asks `Enter path to file`:** no log was open in AdvantageScope. Open one there and run again, or set the `AKIT_LOG_PATH` environment variable to the log's full path.
* **The arm's values in the `_sim` log are all 0:** `RobotContainer` (or `Robot`, in Commands v3) still creates `ArmIOTalonFX` in replay, or the subsystem does not call `Logger.processInputs("Arm", inputs)`.
* **The `_sim` log differs from the original:** something the subsystem uses is not in its inputs. During replay only the `@AutoLog` inputs come from the log: anything read straight from a motor, a sensor or YAMS's own telemetry is live simulation instead. Add it to `ArmIOInputs`.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Summary**: With YAMS + AdvantageKit, you only need **2 IO classes** per mechanism:

1. **One real IO class** (e.g., `ArmIOTalonFX`): works for both real robot and simulation
2. **One empty replay IO class** (e.g., `ArmIOReplay`): for log replay only

Compare this to traditional AdvantageKit which requires **3 IO classes** (Real, Sim, Replay).
{% endhint %}

## Pattern summary

The steps in this tutorial follow one pattern for using YAMS with AdvantageKit:

1. **The IO class builds the YAMS mechanism** (`Arm`, `Elevator`, `FlyWheel`, etc.), which simulates itself.
2. **It reads the inputs from the mechanism's `SmartMotorController`** (`mechanism.getMotor()`).
3. **It sends setpoints through the `SmartMotorController`**, such as `motor.setPosition(angle)` or `motor.setVelocity(velocity)`.
4. **The subsystem only uses the IO interface and the logged inputs**, so replay makes the same decisions as the robot did.

See the YAMS AdvantageKit examples for complete robot projects that log YAMS mechanisms with AdvantageKit: [Commands v2](https://github.com/Yet-Another-Software-Suite/YAMS/tree/master/examples/commands2/advantage_kit) and [Commands v3](https://github.com/Yet-Another-Software-Suite/YAMS/tree/master/examples/commands3/advantage_kit). They log from the subsystem without an IO layer, as in [Without an IO layer](direct-subsystem.md).
