# How do I write my own mechanism command?

The built-in commands, `run`, `runTo`, `set` and `setVoltage`, cover most needs. When they do not, for example when the target needs extra logic every loop, when an AdvantageKit IO class sets it, or when a state machine decides it, set the target yourself with the mechanism's **setpoint functions**. This page shows each case.

[Controlling a mechanism](controlling-a-mechanism.md#setpoint-functions) lists every setpoint function for each mechanism.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/setpoint-two-ways.png" alt="Two paths to the same SmartMotorController. A command helper such as arm.run returns a Command that requires the subsystem; a button binding or auto sequence schedules it, and the scheduler stops it when another command needs the mechanism. A direct setpoint method such as arm.setMechanismPositionSetpoint returns nothing and sets the target at once; it is called from your own code, such as a custom command, an IO class or a state machine, and nothing is scheduled."><figcaption><p>A built-in command and a setpoint function end at the same motor controller.</p></figcaption></figure>

## The rules

* **A setpoint function sets the target and returns at once.** It is not a command, and it does not require the subsystem. Call it from inside a command that does, so two pieces of code never fight over the motor.
* **Position and velocity setpoint functions start the closed loop if it was stopped.** Voltage and duty cycle ones stop it. You do not need to manage the loop when you use them.
* **Starting a stopped loop resets it** to where the mechanism is now: the PID controller, the motion profile and the LQR's estimate start fresh. On a loop that is already running, starting it does nothing, so calling `setMechanismPositionSetpoint(...)` every loop is fine.
* **The motor keeps its last request when your command ends,** as with the built-in commands. See [When mechanism commands end](run-vs-runto.md).

## A command with extra logic

This command follows a target from a supplier, and adds 5 degrees while the arm is below level.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Commands v2" %}
```java
package first.robot.commands;

import static org.wpilib.units.Units.Degrees;

import java.util.function.Supplier;
import org.wpilib.command2.Command;
import org.wpilib.units.measure.Angle;
import first.robot.subsystems.ArmSubsystem;

public class OffsetArmCommand extends Command
{
  private final ArmSubsystem    armSubsystem;
  private final Supplier<Angle> target;

  public OffsetArmCommand(ArmSubsystem armSubsystem, Supplier<Angle> target)
  {
    this.armSubsystem = armSubsystem;
    this.target = target;
    addRequirements(armSubsystem); // so no other command drives the arm at the same time
  }

  @Override
  public void execute()
  {
    Angle goal = target.get();
    if (armSubsystem.getArm().getAngle().lt(Degrees.of(0)))
    {
      goal = goal.plus(Degrees.of(5)); // below level, aim a little higher
    }
    armSubsystem.getArm().setMechanismPositionSetpoint(goal); // safe every loop
  }
}
```

`getArm()` is a getter you add to `ArmSubsystem` that returns its YAMS `Arm` field. The command never finishes, so bind it with `whileTrue`, or use it as a default command.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Commands v3" %}
Commands v3 has no command classes with `execute()`. Write the same logic as a `while (true)` coroutine in your `ArmMechanism`, where `arm` is its YAMS `Arm` field:

```java
// In ArmMechanism
public Command offsetTo(Supplier<Angle> target)
{
  return run(coroutine -> {
    while (true)
    {
      Angle goal = target.get();
      if (arm.getAngle().lt(Degrees.of(0)))
      {
        goal = goal.plus(Degrees.of(5)); // below level, aim a little higher
      }
      arm.setMechanismPositionSetpoint(goal); // safe every loop
      coroutine.yield();
    }
  }).named("Arm Offset To");
}
```

`run(...)` on a `Mechanism` requires that mechanism, so no other command drives the arm at the same time.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

To end a command like this when the arm arrives, check `arm.isNear(goal, tolerance)`: in Commands v2 return it from `isFinished()`, and in Commands v3 make it the `while` condition.

## An AdvantageKit IO class

An IO class is called by the subsystem, which owns the requirement, so it uses the setpoint functions directly. Take `Measure` types, not `double`:

```java
// Fragment: ArmIO is your IO interface, with setTargetAngle(Angle) and setVoltage(Voltage).
public class ArmIOYAMS implements ArmIO
{
  private final Arm arm; // built as in the Arm tutorial

  public ArmIOYAMS(Arm arm)
  {
    this.arm = arm;
  }

  @Override
  public void setTargetAngle(Angle angle)
  {
    arm.setMechanismPositionSetpoint(angle); // starts the closed loop if it was stopped
  }

  @Override
  public void setVoltage(Voltage volts)
  {
    arm.setVoltageSetpoint(volts); // stops the closed loop
  }
}
```

[AdvantageKit Integration](advantagekit-integration.md) builds the whole IO layer.

## A state machine (Commands v3)

WPILib's Commands v3 has a state machine built in, `org.wpilib.command3.StateMachine`. Each state runs one command, and transitions say when to move to another state. The state machine cancels the current state's command and starts the next one for you.

```java
// Fragment of ArmMechanism. motorConfig, motor and armConfig are built as in the Arm tutorial.
private static final Angle STOW_ANGLE   = Degrees.of(0);
private static final Angle INTAKE_ANGLE = Degrees.of(-20);
private static final Angle SCORE_ANGLE  = Degrees.of(80);
private static final Angle TOLERANCE    = Degrees.of(2);

private final Arm arm = new Arm(armConfig, motor);

/** The command for one state: hold an angle until the state machine moves on. */
private Command holdAt(String name, Angle angle)
{
  return run(coroutine -> {
    while (true)
    {
      arm.setMechanismPositionSetpoint(angle); // safe every loop
      coroutine.yield();
    }
  }).named(name);
}

/** Build the arm's state machine. It is itself a Command. */
public Command stateMachine(BooleanSupplier intakeRequested, BooleanSupplier scoreRequested,
                            BooleanSupplier hasGamePiece)
{
  StateMachine machine = new StateMachine("Arm State Machine");

  State stowed   = machine.addState(holdAt("Arm Stowed", STOW_ANGLE));
  State intaking = machine.addState(holdAt("Arm Intaking", INTAKE_ANGLE));
  State scoring  = machine.addState(holdAt("Arm Scoring", SCORE_ANGLE));

  machine.setInitialState(stowed);

  stowed.switchTo(intaking).when(intakeRequested);
  stowed.switchTo(scoring).when(() -> scoreRequested.getAsBoolean() && hasGamePiece.getAsBoolean());
  intaking.switchTo(stowed).when(hasGamePiece);  // stow once a game piece is in
  scoring.switchTo(stowed).when(() -> arm.isNear(SCORE_ANGLE, TOLERANCE) && !hasGamePiece.getAsBoolean());

  return machine;
}
```

The imports are `org.wpilib.command3.StateMachine`, `org.wpilib.command3.StateMachine.State` and `java.util.function.BooleanSupplier`. Schedule it like any other command. A `Trigger` is a `BooleanSupplier`, so buttons can be the conditions:

```java
// In Robot. arm is your ArmMechanism; intake.hasGamePiece() is your own sensor check.
Scheduler.getDefault().schedule(arm.stateMachine(controller.a(), controller.b(), intake::hasGamePiece));
```

How it behaves:

* **`setInitialState(state)` is required.** Without it the state machine throws when it starts.
* **`when(condition)` fires when the condition turns from false to true while that state is active.** A button already held when the state starts does not count until it is released and pressed again.
* **If two transitions fire in the same loop, the first one declared wins.**
* **The state machine itself requires nothing; each state's command requires the arm.** Another command that takes the arm cancels the running state, and with no `whenComplete()` transition from that state, the state machine exits.
* **A state whose command ends by itself, with no `whenComplete()` transition, also ends the state machine.** These `holdAt` commands never end, so this one runs until it is canceled.

## Driving the motor controller yourself

You can skip the mechanism and call the `SmartMotorController` from `arm.getMotorController()`, with `setPosition(...)`, `setVelocity(...)`, `setVoltage(...)` or `setDutyCycle(...)`. That is what the built-in commands do inside. These calls do not start or stop the closed loop, so do it once when your command starts:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/setpoint-closed-loop-state.png" alt="Two panels. Position or velocity setpoints, such as setMechanismPositionSetpoint and setMechanismVelocitySetpoint, need the closed loop running: call startClosedLoopController once when your command starts, or the setpoint is ignored and the mechanism does not move. Voltage or duty cycle setpoints, setVoltageSetpoint and setDutyCycleSetpoint, need the closed loop stopped: call stopClosedLoopController once when your command starts, or the loop overwrites your output on its next run. This only matters when the closed loop runs on the SystemCore, and the command helpers do it for you."><figcaption><p>Start the closed loop for position and velocity. Stop it for voltage and duty cycle.</p></figcaption></figure>

```java
// In ArmSubsystem. arm is the YAMS Arm field.
/** Drive the arm by voltage, for example from a joystick. */
public Command manual(Supplier<Voltage> volts)

          motor::stopClosedLoopController,      // once, at the start
          () -> motor.setVoltage(volts.get()))  // every loop
      .withName("Arm Manual");
}

/** Hold an angle that can change while the command runs. */
public Command track(Supplier<Angle> angle)
{

          motor::startClosedLoopController,     // once, at the start
          () -> motor.setPosition(angle.get())) // every loop
      .withName("Arm Track");
}

{% tab title="Commands v3" %}
```java
// In ArmMechanism. arm is the YAMS Arm field.
/** Drive the arm by voltage, for example from a joystick. */
public Command manual(Supplier<Voltage> volts)
{
  SmartMotorController motor = arm.getMotorController();
  return run(coroutine -> {
    motor.stopClosedLoopController();           // once, at the start
    while (true)
    {
      motor.setVoltage(volts.get());            // every loop
      coroutine.yield();
    }
  }).named("Arm Manual");
}

/** Hold an angle that can change while the command runs. */
public Command track(Supplier<Angle> angle)
{
  SmartMotorController motor = arm.getMotorController();
  return run(coroutine -> {
    motor.startClosedLoopController();          // once, at the start
    while (true)
    {
      motor.setPosition(angle.get());           // every loop
      coroutine.yield();
    }
  }).named("Arm Track");
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Some closed loops run on the motor controller and some on the SystemCore: [Where the loop runs](editor/config/closed-loop-control.md#where-the-loop-runs) lists which. When the loop runs on the motor controller, `startClosedLoopController()` and `stopClosedLoopController()` do nothing, so the same code works everywhere and keeps working if you change motor controller later. Both also start or stop the loop of each loosely coupled follower.
