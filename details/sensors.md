# Sensors

YAMS simulates your mechanisms well, but most sensors have no simulation of their own: in simulation a beam break never breaks and a limit switch is never pressed. A YAMS `Sensor` fixes that.

## What is a `Sensor`?

A `Sensor` wraps a real sensor on your robot, such as a beam break, a limit switch, a `CANrange`, a `LaserCAN` or a `CanandColor`. It has one or more named **fields**, and each field reads a value from the real sensor. In simulation you can also say what each field should read, and when: between two match times, or while a condition is true, such as the arm being at the angle where it breaks the beam.

Fields hold `boolean`, `int`, `long` or `double` values.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/sensor-value-source.png" alt="Two panels. On the real robot, getAsBoolean returns the real sensor reading from the supplier you gave, and simulated values are ignored. In simulation, the first simulated value whose condition is true is returned. Otherwise the value shown in the Sim GUI is returned, which starts as the default and can be changed by hand or with getField and set."><figcaption><p>Your code makes the same call on the real robot and in simulation.</p></figcaption></figure>

## How do I create a `Sensor`?

Build it with a `SensorConfig`, which takes the sensor's name, then a field for each value it reports.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Declare the `Sensor` field after every field its lambdas use, such as the `DigitalInput`, the motor and the mechanism. Java does not let a field's initializer use a field declared after it, even inside a lambda.
{% endhint %}

```java
import static org.wpilib.units.Units.Degrees;
import static org.wpilib.units.Units.Seconds;

import org.wpilib.hardware.discrete.DigitalInput;
import yams.core.mechanisms.config.SensorConfig;
import yams.core.motorcontrollers.simulation.Sensor;

// Fields of your subsystem, after the arm field
private final DigitalInput dio = new DigitalInput(0);
private final Sensor coralSensor = new SensorConfig("CoralDetectorBeamBreak") // the sensor's name
    .withField("Beam", dio::get, false)                              // field "Beam" reads dio.get(), default false
    .withSimulatedValue("Beam", Seconds.of(3), Seconds.of(4), true)  // in simulation, true while the match time is 3 to 4 s
    .withSimulatedValue("Beam", () -> arm.isNear(Degrees.of(40), Degrees.of(2)), true) // and while the arm is near 40 degrees
    .getSensor();
```

Reading through a `Sensor` is a little slower than reading the input directly. For a beam break or a limit switch that does not matter.

## How do I add simulated values to a sensor?

You can add a simulated value to a `Sensor` you already have with `addSimTrigger(field, value, condition)`. The value is a `HALValue` (`org.wpilib.hardware.hal.HALValue`), for example `HALValue.makeBoolean(true)`.

```java
// Fragment: coralSensor is the Sensor above, without its second withSimulatedValue
coralSensor.addSimTrigger("Beam", HALValue.makeBoolean(true),
                          () -> arm.isNear(Degrees.of(40), Degrees.of(2))); // true while the arm is near 40 degrees
```

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/sensor-sim-values.gif" alt="Animation of the Beam field of a beam break sensor in simulation, false by default. It turns true while the arm is within 2 degrees of 40 degrees, turns false when the arm moves on, turns true again while the match time is between 3 and 4 seconds, and then goes back to false."><figcaption><p>The field reads true while either simulated value is true, and goes back to what it was when neither is.</p></figcaption></figure>

## What does this look like?

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt="The simulation GUI with the Other Devices panel open. Below the SPARK MAX entries is a Sensor[CoralDetectorBeamBreak] entry, circled in red, with its Beam field reading false in a drop-down that can be changed by hand."><figcaption><p>The sensor's fields appear under Other Devices in the simulation GUI.</p></figcaption></figure>

The circled value turns true while the arm is within 2° of 40°. You can also change it by hand in the simulation GUI.

## How do I use the value from a `Sensor`?

{% hint style="warning" %}
A simulated value only updates when your code reads the sensor. Read it every loop, for example from a `Trigger` or `periodic()`, or its simulated values never take effect.
{% endhint %}

Read the field from the `Sensor`, not from the input it wraps:

```java
public boolean getBeamBreak()
{
  // return dio.get(); // does not see the simulated values
  return coralSensor.getAsBoolean("Beam");
}
```

`getAsInt`, `getAsLong` and `getAsDouble` read the other kinds of field.

## How do I simulate the sensor value?

You can set a field by hand: get it with `getField` and call `set`. The new value stays until it is changed again, from the simulation GUI or with `set`.

{% hint style="info" %}
This only changes the value in simulation. It does not affect the real sensor on the robot.
{% endhint %}

}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Commands v3" %}

public void setBeamBreakWhenArmIsLow()
{
  arm.lte(Degrees.of(10)).onTrue(Command.noRequirements(coroutine -> coralSensor.getField("Beam").set(true))
                                        .named("Set Beam Break"));
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## How do I simulate a sensor the mechanism triggers?

Some sensors are triggered by the mechanism itself, like a limit switch at a hard stop, or a beam break the arm passes through. Simulate those from where the simulated mechanism really is, rather than from what its encoder says. The motor's sim supplier (`SmartMotorController.getSimSupplier()`) has the simulated mechanism's position. It is empty on a real robot, so the condition is `false` there.

```java
// Fields of ArmSubsystem, after motor
private final DigitalInput lowerSwitchInput = new DigitalInput(4);
private final Sensor lowerSwitch = new SensorConfig("ArmLowerSwitch")
    .withField("Pressed", lowerSwitchInput::get, false)
    // Pressed while the simulated arm is within 0.05° of its lower hard stop at -30°.
    .withSimulatedValue("Pressed", () -> motor.getSimSupplier()
        .map(sim -> sim.getMechanismPosition().lte(Degrees.of(-29.95)))
        .orElse(false), true)
    .getSensor();
```

For an elevator, convert the simulated position to a height with the motor controller's config: `smcConfig.convertFromMechanism(sim.getMechanismPosition())`.

A real limit switch is pressed by the mechanism, not by its encoder. If the encoder is off, say after a belt skips, a switch simulated from the encoder (`arm.isNear(...)`) is pressed in the wrong place. One simulated from the sim supplier is pressed at the hard stop, as the real one is.

A SystemCore Smart IO port reads `true` while a normally open switch, wired between the signal and power pins, is pressed. So the field is `input::get`, not `!input.get()`.

To reset the encoder each time a limit switch is pressed, see [How do I home a mechanism with limit switches?](../how-to/how-do-i-home-a-mechanism-with-limit-switches.md) [YAMG](https://yamg.yassrobotics.com) generates the sensor and the homing code when you turn on **Homing**.
