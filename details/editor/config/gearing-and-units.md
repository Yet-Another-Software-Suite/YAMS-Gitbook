# Gearing and units

These options tell YAMS how the motor's rotation becomes the mechanism's movement. Every position and velocity YAMS reports depends on them, so get them right before tuning.

The options on this page connect the **rotor** (the motor's own shaft), the **mechanism** (the output after the gearing) and the **measurement** (the distance a mechanism moves in a line). [Rotor, mechanism and measurement](../../how-yams-drives-a-motor.md#rotor-mechanism-and-measurement) defines them with a picture.

## `withGearing`

The reduction between the rotor and the mechanism.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/smc-gearing.png" alt="A motor rotor drives a gearbox with 3 to 1 and 4 to 1 stages, 12 to 1 in total, which drives the mechanism&#x27;s output shaft. Twelve rotor rotations are one mechanism rotation. GearBox.fromReductionStages(3, 4) and withGearing(12) mean the same."><figcaption><p>A 12:1 reduction in two stages.</p></figcaption></figure>

```java
.withGearing(new MechanismGearing(GearBox.fromReductionStages(3, 4))) // 3:1 then 4:1
.withGearing(12)                                                       // the same, as one number
```

A reduction is a number greater than 1: a "3:1" gearbox is `3`, and a "1:2" overdrive is `0.5`. `GearBox.fromReductionStages` and `Sprocket.fromStages` let you write the stages as they are on the robot.

**Supported on:** every supported motor controller.

## `withMechanismCircumference`

How far the mechanism travels in one rotation of its output. Setting it lets you use distances (`Meters`, `Inches`) anywhere YAMS takes an angle.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/smc-circumference.png" alt="A drum with its radius marked. One mechanism rotation is one circumference of travel, two times pi times the radius. The same value can be given with withMechanismCircumference, withWheelRadius or withWheelDiameter, withDrumRadius, or withDrumRadius with a chain pitch and tooth count."><figcaption><p>One rotation of the drum is one circumference of travel.</p></figcaption></figure>

```java
.withMechanismCircumference(Meters.of(0.25))
.withWheelRadius(Inches.of(2))            // or withWheelDiameter(Inches.of(4))
.withDrumRadius(Inches.of(1))
.withDrumRadius(Inches.of(0.25), 22)      // chain pitch and sprocket teeth
```

All of these set the same value. Use whichever matches what you can measure. [How do I find my mechanism's circumference?](../../../how-to/how-to-find-your-mechanism-circumference.md) covers the measuring.

Several options need it first and throw a `SmartMotorControllerConfigurationException` without it: distance `withSoftLimits`, distance `withExternalEncoderZeroOffset`, and anything else that takes a `Distance`.

**Supported on:** every supported motor controller.

## `withCascadingElevatorStages`

Divides the gearing by the number of cascading stages, because each stage adds the same travel again.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/smc-cascading-stages.png" alt="Three elevators with one, two and three cascading stages. For the same motor movement the carriage travels one, two and three times as far, so the gearing is divided by the number of stages."><figcaption><p>The carriage of a cascading elevator moves further than the first stage.</p></figcaption></figure>

```java
.withGearing(new MechanismGearing(GearBox.fromReductionStages(5, 4)))
.withCascadingElevatorStages(2)
```

Call it after `withGearing`: it changes the gearing that is already set. Continuous elevators, where one belt or rope runs through every stage, do not need it.

**Supported on:** every supported motor controller.
