# Simulation

These options only change what happens in simulation. The real robot ignores them.

Every option on this page is supported on every supported motor controller.

## `withSimClosedLoopController` and `withSimFeedforward`

A second set of gains used only in simulation. They take the same arguments, including [slots](closed-loop-control.md#slots), as [`withClosedLoopController`](closed-loop-control.md#withclosedloopcontroller) and [`withFeedforward`](feedforward.md#withfeedforward).

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/smc-sim-gains.png" alt="A diagram. On the real robot the closed loop controller uses the gains from withClosedLoopController and withFeedforward to drive the real mechanism, which has friction, backlash and flex. In simulation it uses the gains from withSimClosedLoopController and withSimFeedforward to drive a simulated mechanism, an ideal motor and load."><figcaption><p>Real gains for the real mechanism, simulation gains for the simulated one.</p></figcaption></figure>

```java
.withClosedLoopController(4, 0, 0.2)
.withSimClosedLoopController(12, 0, 0)
.withFeedforward(new ArmFeedforward(0.15, 0.35, 1.2))
.withSimFeedforward(new ArmFeedforward(0, 0.3, 1.2))
```

[Simulation-only PID + feedforward](../simulation-only-pid-+-feedforward.md) explains why the two usually differ, with an example.

## `withSimStartingPosition`

Where the simulated mechanism starts, when that should differ from the real [starting position](encoders.md#withstartingposition).

```java
.withSimStartingPosition(Degrees.of(45))
```

It is most useful with an absolute encoder: the real robot reads its position from the encoder, and simulation needs to be told one.

## `withMomentOfInertia`

How hard the simulated load is to spin up. An `Arm`, `Pivot` and `FlyWheel` simulate with this value, and so does a `SmartMotorController` simulated on its own. The default is 0.02 kg·m², so set it for anything heavier than a small roller. An `Elevator` uses its carriage mass instead.

```java
.withMomentOfInertia(KilogramSquareMeters.of(0.02))          // from CAD
.withMomentOfInertia(Inches.of(18), Pounds.of(8))           // an arm: a rod of this length and mass, turning about one end
.withWheelMomentOfInertia(Inches.of(4), Pounds.of(1))       // a wheel or roller: a solid disk of this diameter and mass
```

Use exactly one; the last call wins. For a wheel, `withWheelMomentOfInertia` gives about a third of what the arm version gives for the same numbers, so don't use the arm version for wheels.

## `withSimulationPeriod`

How often the simulated physics are stepped. The default is 20 ms, and it is independent of [`withClosedLoopControlPeriod`](closed-loop-control.md#withclosedloopcontrolperiod).

```java
.withSimulationPeriod(Milliseconds.of(5))
```

Each `simIterate()` call steps the physics by exactly this period, so it must match how often `simIterate()` is called. To step every 1 ms, as fast as a closed loop on the motor controller runs, call it from a `Notifier`: see [How do I run a high fidelity simulation?](../../../how-to/how-do-i-run-a-high-fidelity-simulation.md)

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/smc-simulation.png" alt="Two graphs. Simulated speed: a small moment of inertia spins up quickly and a large one more slowly, set by withMomentOfInertia. Simulated position: 20 millisecond steps, the default, make a coarse staircase and 5 millisecond steps make a finer curve, set by withSimulationPeriod."><figcaption><p>Moment of inertia and simulation period.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Running the simulation

A mechanism class steps its motor's simulation for you when you call its `simIterate()`. A `SmartMotorController` used without a mechanism class needs its own `simIterate()` called every loop in simulation, and its own `updateTelemetry()` called every loop, so it publishes values and picks up live tuning. In a Commands v2 subsystem:

```java
@Override
public void periodic() {
  smartMotorController.updateTelemetry();
}

@Override
public void simulationPeriodic() {
  smartMotorController.simIterate();
}
```

In Commands v3, call them from the methods `Robot.java` runs, as in [Where the tutorials put things](../../../tutorials/project-setup.md#where-the-tutorials-put-things). Every simulated motor also draws from the shared [battery simulation](../../../understanding/battery-simulation.md).
