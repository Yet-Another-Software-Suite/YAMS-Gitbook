# Followers

Two ways to have more than one motor move one mechanism: **tightly coupled** followers and **loosely coupled** followers.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/smc-followers.png" alt="Two panels. Tightly coupled, withFollowers: a leader and a follower are on one shaft or gearbox and the follower copies the leader&#x27;s output. The motors are mechanically locked, there is one closed loop and one config, the followers are the same vendor as the leader, and voltage and duty cycle reach every motor. Loosely coupled, withLooselyCoupledFollowers: two separate motors joined only by the mechanism get the same setpoint and each runs its own PID. They are not mechanically locked, each has its own closed loop and config, vendors can be mixed, and voltage and duty cycle are not forwarded, so the leader moves alone."><figcaption><p>Tightly coupled followers share a shaft. Loosely coupled followers are separate motors.</p></figcaption></figure>

| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The motors are         | Mechanically locked on one shaft or gearbox                 | Separate, joined only by the mechanism                                           |
| Closed loop            | One, on the leader. Followers copy its output               | One on each motor, on its own encoder                                            |

## `withFollowers`

Tightly coupled followers, for motors on the same shaft or gearbox. Each follower copies the leader's output, so only the leader needs a config.

```java
.withFollowers(Pair.of(new SparkMax(CANPort.CAN_S0, 4, MotorType.kBrushless), false),
               Pair.of(new SparkMax(CANPort.CAN_S0, 5, MotorType.kBrushless), true))
```

Pass the vendor's motor object, not a `SmartMotorController`. The boolean is whether that follower is inverted relative to the leader: motors facing each other across a gearbox usually are.

**Supported on every motor controller.** Followers must be the same vendor as the leader. A TalonFX and a TalonFXS are both CTRE, so either can follow the other. To mix brands, use [`withLooselyCoupledFollowers`](followers.md#withlooselycoupledfollowers).

| TalonFX                          | TalonFXS                         | SPARK MAX / Flex       | Thrifty Nova          |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| ✅ TalonFX and TalonFXS followers | ✅ TalonFXS and TalonFX followers | ✅ SPARK followers only | ✅ Nova followers only |

## `withLooselyCoupledFollowers`

Loosely coupled followers are for motors that are not on the same shaft or gearbox but must arrive at the same place: an intake arm driven from both sides, two linear actuators joined by a cross bar, or a shooter with a wheel on each end. Each follower is a full `SmartMotorController` with its own config, its own encoder and its own closed loop. The leader sends it every position and velocity setpoint it is given.

**You can mix brands.** Because each motor closes its own loop, a loosely coupled follower can be any supported motor controller, whatever the leader is, such as a SPARK leading a TalonFX.

**Supported on:** every supported motor controller.

### Use them with a mechanism class

A mechanism class such as `Arm`, `Elevator` or `FlyWheel` works with loosely coupled followers. Give the mechanism the leader, and name the followers in the leader's config. The mechanism's commands, such as `arm.setAngle(...)`, then move every motor.

In `Robot.java`, call `intakeArm.periodic()` from `robotPeriodic()` and start `intakeArm::simulationPeriodic` in a `Notifier` from `simulationInit()`, exactly as for any mechanism in [Where the tutorials put things](../../../tutorials/project-setup.md#where-the-tutorials-put-things). The imports are the ones in [Step 3 of the Arm tutorial](../../../tutorials/arm/commands.md), plus `Meters`, and the `simple_robot-2027` example has a complete [Commands v3 arm mechanism](https://github.com/Yet-Another-Software-Suite/YAMS/blob/master/examples/commands3/simple_robot-2027/src/main/java/first/robot/mechanisms/ArmMechanism.java).

Create each follower before the leader, and name it in the leader's config:

```cpp
m_rightMotor.emplace(&m_rightSpark, wpi::math::DCMotor::NEO(1), &m_rightConfig);

m_leftConfig
    // ... config options
    .WithLooselyCoupledFollowers({&m_rightMotor.value()});  // the right motor is sent the left motor's setpoints

m_leftMotor.emplace(&m_leftSpark, wpi::math::DCMotor::NEO(1), &m_leftConfig);
```

Call `UpdateTelemetry()` and `SimIterate()` on each follower, as on the arm.

| A position or velocity setpoint, such as from `arm.setAngle(...)` or `flywheel.run(...)`                                              | Are sent the same setpoint, and each reaches it with its own closed loop                          |
| A change from live tuning: gains, feedforward, motion profile, current limits, ramp rates, soft limits, gearing or closed loop slot | Are given the same change                                                                         |
| A duty cycle of 0, which stops it                                                                                                    | Stop too\*                                                                                        |
| Any other duty cycle or voltage, such as from `arm.set(...)`, `arm.setVoltage(...)` or SysId                                         | **Are not sent it.** The leader moves alone, and the followers are stopped\*                      |
| `setEncoderPosition(...)`, such as when zeroing or homing                                                                            | **Are not sent it.** Set each follower's encoder yourself                                         |
| `updateTelemetry()` and `simIterate()`                                                                                               | **Are not updated.** Call them on each follower yourself                                          |

\* A follower whose closed loop runs on the SystemCore only stops in YAMS releases after v2026.10.15. See the first pitfall below.

### Common pitfalls

* **The follower doesn't stop (YAMS v2026.10.15 and earlier).** A follower's closed loop runs on the SystemCore when it is a Thrifty Nova, a SPARK with an exponential profile, or any motor controller with an LQR. In YAMS v2026.10.15 and earlier, stopping the leader doesn't stop that loop, so the follower keeps driving to the last setpoint: on through `arm.set(0)`, and against the leader through `arm.set(...)`, `arm.setVoltage(...)` and SysId. Later releases stop it with the leader. Until you update, stop the follower's closed loop yourself while the leader is driven at a duty cycle or voltage. In Commands v2:

  ```java
  arm.set(dutyCycle)
      .beforeStarting(() -> {
        rightMotor.stopClosedLoopController();
        rightMotor.setDutyCycle(0);
      })
      .finallyDo(rightMotor::startClosedLoopController);
  ```
* **The follower does nothing in simulation, and logs nothing.** Call `updateTelemetry()` and `simIterate()` on each follower, every loop.
* **The follower doesn't follow the profile.** The leader sends the follower the final setpoint, so a follower needs the same motion profile as the leader, and the same gearing, gains and feedforward, or it gets there at a different speed.
* **The follower drives the wrong way.** Each motor is inverted in its own config, with `withMotorInverted`. Motors on opposite sides of a mechanism usually face each other, so one of them is inverted.
* **The two sides fight.** Nothing keeps the motors together except the mechanism: each one only follows its own encoder. If they start at different positions, or one side slips, they pull against each other through the mechanism. Give every motor the same starting position, and when you zero or home the mechanism, set every motor's encoder.
* **Manual control moves only one side.** A voltage or duty cycle, such as manual control with a joystick or a SysId routine, only drives the leader, and the followers are stopped. Command each motor yourself, or characterize one side with the other side unpowered.

### Motors that need different setpoints

Loosely coupled followers are sent the leader's setpoints exactly. When the motors need different ones, such as two flywheels spinning at different speeds, command each `SmartMotorController` yourself: see [How do I control a mechanism without a mechanism class?](../../../how-to/how-do-i-control-a-mechanism-without-a-mechanism-class.md) and the [double flywheel tutorial](../../../tutorials/double-flywheel/spin-and-followers.md).
