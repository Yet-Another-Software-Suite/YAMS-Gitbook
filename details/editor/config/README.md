# SmartMotorControllerConfig

A `SmartMotorControllerConfig` describes one motor: how it is geared, how it is controlled, what it must not do and what it reports. You write it once, in the same way for every vendor, and hand it to a wrapper such as `TalonFXWrapper`, `SparkWrapper` or `NovaWrapper`.

## How the config is used

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/smc-config-flow.png" alt="A flow diagram. Your SmartMotorControllerConfig goes to a wrapper such as TalonFXWrapper, SparkWrapper or NovaWrapper, which translates each option into the vendor&#x27;s own config, which is sent once at startup to the motor controller. An option the controller cannot do throws an exception at startup that names the method to change."><figcaption><p>The same config works for every supported motor controller.</p></figcaption></figure>

```java
SmartMotorControllerConfig config = new SmartMotorControllerConfig(this)
    .withControlMode(ControlMode.CLOSED_LOOP)
    .withGearing(new MechanismGearing(GearBox.fromReductionStages(3, 4)))
    .withClosedLoopController(4, 0, 0)
    .withFeedforward(new ArmFeedforward(0, 0.3, 1.2))
    .withTrapezoidalProfile(DegreesPerSecond.of(180), DegreesPerSecondPerSecond.of(360))
    .withSoftLimits(Degrees.of(-20), Degrees.of(100))
    .withStatorCurrentLimit(Amps.of(40))
    .withZeroPower(MotorMode.BRAKE)
    .withTelemetry("ArmMotor", TelemetryVerbosity.HIGH);

SparkMax spark = new SparkMax(CANPort.CAN_S0, 4, MotorType.kBrushless);
SmartMotorController motor = new SparkWrapper(spark, DCMotor.getNEO(1), config);
```

This is a fragment: it goes inside a subsystem, which is the `this` passed to the config. [Step 1 of the Arm tutorial](../../../tutorials/arm/motor-controller.md) builds the same thing as a complete file.

Three things are worth knowing before reading the option pages:

* **Every `with...()` method returns the config**, so options chain. A few options depend on an earlier one and say so on their page, for example `withClosedLoopTolerance` needs a PID controller first.
* **Options are checked when the wrapper is created.** An option that motor controller cannot do throws an exception, so problems show up at startup and not mid-match. It is usually a `SmartMotorControllerConfigurationException` that names the method to change, and for a few options an `IllegalArgumentException`. Each option says which.
* **The motor's config holds the motor's limits.** Soft limits, starting position and gearing go on the `SmartMotorControllerConfig`, even when a mechanism uses the motor. The mechanism's own config (`ArmConfig`, `ElevatorConfig` and so on) describes the mechanism: its length, mass and hard stops.

## Not every option works on every motor controller

{% hint style="warning" %}
Motor controllers differ. Some options only exist on one of them, and some only work in certain situations, for example only when the closed loop runs on the SystemCore. An option a controller cannot do normally throws a `SmartMotorControllerConfigurationException` or an `IllegalArgumentException` at startup, but check the table for each option you rely on.
{% endhint %}

Every option on the following pages has a table showing where it works. The [motor controller feature matrix](../feature-matrix.md#feature-support-matrix) has every option against every motor controller in one place. The ones that most often catch teams out:

* **TalonFX and TalonFXS:** no [`withClosedLoopTolerance`](closed-loop-control.md#withclosedlooptolerance), no [`withVoltageCompensation`](limits-and-protection.md#withvoltagecompensation), no `SLOT_3`, and [`withEncoderInverted`](encoders.md#withencoderinverted) only on a TalonFXS.
* **SPARK MAX and SPARK Flex:** no [supply current limit](limits-and-protection.md#withstatorcurrentlimit-and-withsupplycurrentlimit) and no [`withVendorControlRequest`](motor-basics.md#withvendorcontrolrequest). Several options only work when the loop runs on the SystemCore, with an exponential profile or an [LQR](../lqr-controllers.md).
* **Thrifty Nova:** everything closed loop runs on the SystemCore, and it has [one ramp rate](limits-and-protection.md#withopenloopramprate-and-withclosedloopramprate) for open and closed loop control.
* **Everywhere:** [soft limits](limits-and-protection.md#withsoftlimits) only work in closed loop mode, and [`withVendorConfig`](motor-basics.md#withvendorconfig), [`withExternalEncoder`](encoders.md#withexternalencoder) and [`withFollowers`](followers.md#withfollowers) only take that vendor's own parts.

Many of these depend on where the closed loop runs, which is explained in [where the loop runs](closed-loop-control.md#where-the-loop-runs).

## Changing a config later

Most options can be changed while the robot runs through [live tuning](../../live-tuning/), which is the quickest way to find gains and limits. Once you have them, put the numbers back in the config so they survive a restart.
