# How do I shoot on the move?

**Goal:** score while the robot is still driving, instead of stopping to line up first.

Start with [Shoot on the move: worked example](shoot-on-the-move-example.md): it builds a robot that aims, sets its shooter speed from a lookup table, and feeds only when the shot is ready, in Java with Commands v2 and Commands v3. This page lists where to learn the math, and which YAMS call does each job the sources ask for. [Shooting on the move](../details/shooters.md#shooting-on-the-move) explains the idea, and what the [Swerve Input Stream](../details/swerve-input-stream.md) does and does not do for you.

We covered this in a YASS Weekly Workshop, **How To Program Target Tracking And Shooting On The Fly for FRC**:

Part 1 explains the idea as plain vector math, then covers what goes wrong on a real robot: latency, a flywheel that slows and slips, spin and drag, lobbed shots, and a shooter that is itself moving. Part 2 is the practical side: building the lookup table, getting the shot's speed from the time of flight, shooters with a hood, and tuning the latency. |

## How the sources' ideas apply to YAMS

Each row is a concept from the sources, where to read about it, and the YAMS piece that does that job.

| Concept | Read about it in | In YAMS |
| ------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| The robot's position and field velocity | Eeshwar's [part 1](https://blog.eeshwark.com/robotblog/shooting-on-the-fly), "Prerequisites" | `drive.getPose()` and `drive.getFieldRelativeSpeed()` on the [Swerve Drive](../details/swerve-drive.md) |
| A lookup table of shots that score, measured standing still | [Static Shooting via Look-Up Table](https://frc-docs--3242.org.readthedocs.build/en/3242/docs/software/advanced-controls/fire-control/static-shooting.html), and Eeshwar's [part 2](https://blog.eeshwark.com/robotblog/shooting-on-the-fly-pt2) | WPILib's [`InterpolatingDoubleTreeMap`](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/development/java/org/wpilib/math/interpolation/InterpolatingDoubleTreeMap.html), with the result sent to a [FlyWheel](../details/shooters.md) |
| A flywheel speed that changes every loop | Eeshwar's [part 1](https://blog.eeshwark.com/robotblog/shooting-on-the-fly), "Wait, The Shooter Speed Changed?" | `FlyWheel.run(Supplier)`, which reads the supplier every loop |
| Turning to face a point while the driver keeps driving | Every source | [`withAim`](../details/swerve-input-stream-aim.md#aim-at-a-target), which takes a supplier so the point can move every loop |
| A time of flight lead, as a virtual target | [Dynamic Shooting via Time-of-Flight Recursion](https://frc-docs--3242.org.readthedocs.build/en/3242/docs/software/advanced-controls/fire-control/dynamic-shooting.html), and [Shoot on the move from the code perspective](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/shoot-on-the-move-from-the-code-perspective/511815) | You calculate it. Give the result to `withAim` |
| A time of flight lead, as a shot vector with the robot's velocity subtracted | Eeshwar's [part 1](https://blog.eeshwark.com/robotblog/shooting-on-the-fly), "The Math Implementation", and [part 2](https://blog.eeshwark.com/robotblog/shooting-on-the-fly-pt2), "Getting Horizontal Velocity from ToF" | You calculate it. Give its direction to `withAim`, [`withHeading`](../details/swerve-input-stream-aim.md#heading-snap-control) or a turret, and its speed to the flywheel |
| Latency compensation: aim from where the robot will be | Eeshwar's [part 1](https://blog.eeshwark.com/robotblog/shooting-on-the-fly), "Latency Compensation", and [part 2](https://blog.eeshwark.com/robotblog/shooting-on-the-fly-pt2), "The Latency Constant" | [`withAimLookahead`](../details/swerve-input-stream-aim.md#aim-lookahead) |
| A heading that keeps up with a moving aim point | Specific to turning the whole robot. The sources mostly aim a turret | [`withAimFeedforward`](../details/swerve-input-stream-aim.md#aim-feedforward), and the rotation controller in [`SwerveDriveConfig`](../details/mechanism-configs/swerve-drive-config.md) |
| A shooter that does not point out of the front, or a small aim correction for spin | Eeshwar's [part 1](https://blog.eeshwark.com/robotblog/shooting-on-the-fly), "The Magnus Effect and Air Resistance" | [`withAimHeadingOffset`](../details/swerve-input-stream-aim.md#aim-heading-offset) |
| Only shooting when the shot is trustworthy | [Dynamic Shooting via Time-of-Flight Recursion](https://frc-docs--3242.org.readthedocs.build/en/3242/docs/software/advanced-controls/fire-control/dynamic-shooting.html), "Shot Quality in Practice", and Eeshwar's [part 1](https://blog.eeshwark.com/robotblog/shooting-on-the-fly), "Shooter Wheel Dynamics" | [`aimLock`](../details/swerve-input-stream-aim.md#aim-lock) for the heading. For the speed, compare the flywheel with the speed the shot needs right now, as the worked example's `atSpeed(Supplier)` does in [Add to the shooter](shoot-on-the-move-example.md#add-to-the-shooter): `FlyWheel.near(...)` takes a fixed speed, which goes stale as the target speed changes |
| A hood, or a turret | Eeshwar's [part 2](https://blog.eeshwark.com/robotblog/shooting-on-the-fly-pt2), the hood variants, and the two team calculators | An [Arm](../details/arms.md) or a [Pivot](../details/turrets-wrists.md), each in its own subsystem |

## Tuning the YAMS side

The sources cover how to tune the shot itself. These are the YAMS settings that go with their advice:

| Their advice | The YAMS setting |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| Get the standing shot consistent before anything else (Eeshwar's [part 1](https://blog.eeshwark.com/robotblog/shooting-on-the-fly), "Prerequisites") | The flywheel's gains: see WPILib's [Tuning a Flywheel Velocity Controller](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/advanced-controls/introduction/tuning-flywheel.html) and [How do I shoot with a shooter?](how-to-shoot-with-a-shooter.md) |
| Tune the latency constant by driving straight across the front of the target (Eeshwar's [part 2](https://blog.eeshwark.com/robotblog/shooting-on-the-fly-pt2), "The Latency Constant") | The time you give [`withAimLookahead`](../details/swerve-input-stream-aim.md#aim-lookahead). Start at 0.1 seconds |
| A moving shot is only as good as the pose it starts from | Vision measurements into the drive's pose estimate: see WPILib's [Pose Estimators](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/advanced-controls/state-space/state-space-pose-estimators.html) |
| Watch whether the heading keeps up as you drive past | The rotation controller in [`SwerveDriveConfig`](../details/mechanism-configs/swerve-drive-config.md), then [`withAimFeedforward`](../details/swerve-input-stream-aim.md#aim-feedforward) |
| Hold fire when the shot is not trustworthy ([Dynamic Shooting via Time-of-Flight Recursion](https://frc-docs--3242.org.readthedocs.build/en/3242/docs/software/advanced-controls/fire-control/dynamic-shooting.html), "Shot Quality in Practice") | The tolerance you give [`aimLock`](../details/swerve-input-stream-aim.md#aim-lock), and the speed tolerance in the worked example's `atSpeed(Supplier)` |

## WPILib building blocks

The released WPILib documentation covers the classes the example uses. These pages are written for WPILib 2026. The ideas are the same in 2027, though some classes were renamed: `ChassisSpeeds`, for example, is `ChassisVelocities`.

| Page | Why it matters here |
| ---- | ------------------- |
| [Coordinate System](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/basic-programming/coordinate-system.html) | Which way X, Y and a positive rotation point. |
| [Translation, Rotation, and Pose](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/advanced-controls/geometry/pose.html) | The classes that the distance and direction to the target are calculated with. |
| [Transformations](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/advanced-controls/geometry/transformations.html) | Getting from the center of the robot to where the shooter really is. |
| [Introduction to Kinematics and The ChassisSpeeds Class](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/kinematics-and-odometry/intro-and-chassis-speeds.html) | Robot relative and field relative velocity. |
