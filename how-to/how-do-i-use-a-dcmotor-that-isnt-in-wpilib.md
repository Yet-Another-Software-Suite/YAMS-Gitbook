# How do I use a DCMotor that isn't in WPILib?

**Goal:** simulate a motor that WPILib has no `DCMotor` for, by building one from its datasheet and giving it to your `SmartMotorController`.

Every YAMS wrapper (`SparkWrapper`, `TalonFXWrapper`, `TalonFXSWrapper`, `NovaWrapper`) takes a `DCMotor` (`org.wpilib.math.system.DCMotor`). YAMS uses it to simulate the motor, so a wrong `DCMotor` makes the simulation faster or slower and stronger or weaker than the real robot.

First look for a ready-made one:

* **WPILib's factories** cover the motors it knows: `getNEO`, `getNeo550`, `getNeoVortex`, `getFalcon500`, `getKrakenX60`, `getKrakenX44`, `getMinion` and more.
* **`YMotors`** (`yams.core.motorcontrollers.YMotors`, Java) adds the motors WPILib does not have yet: `YMotors.getThriftyPulsar(1)` for a Thrifty Pulsar 775.

Use one of those if your motor is listed, and skip the rest of this page. Each is just a call to the `DCMotor` constructor, which you can make yourself for any other motor.

### Find the datasheet values


You need four numbers, measured at a nominal voltage (usually 12 V): stall torque, stall current, free current and free speed. Get them from the manufacturer's datasheet, or look the motor up on ReCalc:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/howto-dcmotor-curve.png" alt="A graph of torque and current against motor speed for a Minion at 12 volts. Torque falls in a straight line from the stall torque of 3.1 newton meters at zero speed to zero at the free speed of 7200 RPM. Current falls from the stall current of 200.46 amps to the free current of 1.43 amps. Beside it, the DCMotor constructor takes the nominal voltage, stall torque, stall current, free current, free speed and number of motors, in that order."><figcaption><p>The four datasheet values and where each goes in the constructor.</p></figcaption></figure>

**Check it:** you have all four numbers, and know the voltage they were measured at.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Build the DCMotor

The constructor takes the values in this order. Torque is in newton meters, current in amps and free speed in radians per second.

```java
public DCMotor(
    double nominalVoltage,  // volts the values were measured at
    double stallTorque,     // newton meters
    double stallCurrent,    // amps
    double freeCurrent,     // amps
    double freeSpeed,       // radians per second
    int numMotors)          // motors in the gearbox
```

For example, before WPILib added `DCMotor.getMinion()`, a [Minion motor](https://store.ctr-electronics.com/products/minion-brushless-motor) could be created with:

{% code title="ExampleSubsystem.java (fragment)" %}
```java
import static org.wpilib.units.Units.RPM;
import static org.wpilib.units.Units.RadiansPerSecond;
import org.wpilib.math.system.DCMotor;

// One Minion: 12 V, 3.1 N·m stall torque, 200.46 A stall current,
// 1.43 A free current, 7200 RPM free speed.
private final DCMotor minion =
    new DCMotor(12, 3.1, 200.46, 1.43, RPM.of(7200).in(RadiansPerSecond), 1);
```
{% endcode %}

**Check it:** the code builds.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Give it to the wrapper

Pass your `DCMotor` where the examples pass `DCMotor.getNEO(1)`. This fragment goes in the same class, after the `smcConfig` field:

{% code title="ExampleSubsystem.java (fragment)" %}
```java
private final SparkMax spark = new SparkMax(CANPort.CAN_S0, 4, MotorType.kBrushless);

// The custom DCMotor replaces DCMotor.getNEO(1).
private final SmartMotorController motor = new SparkWrapper(spark, minion, smcConfig);
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
`TalonFXSWrapper` uses the `DCMotor` to choose the TalonFXS motor arrangement, so it only accepts the motors it knows (Minion, NEO, NEO 550, NEO Vortex and Thrifty Pulsar), compared value for value. Any other `DCMotor` throws an `IllegalArgumentException` ("Unknown motor for TalonFXS"). That includes a Pulsar you build yourself: the comparison is exact, so different datasheet numbers or a different unit conversion fail it. With a TalonFXS, use the factory, such as `DCMotor.getMinion(1)` or `YMotors.getThriftyPulsar(1)`.
{% endhint %}

**Check it:** the robot code starts in simulation without an exception.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Check it

1. Start the simulation and run the mechanism at full output (for example a `set(1)` command).
2. Watch the motor's `rotor/velocity` under **NetworkTables > Mechanisms**. With little load it should level off near the motor's free speed: 7200 RPM is 120 rotations per second.

## If it did not work

* **The simulated motor is far too fast or too slow.** A value is in the wrong unit: free speed must be in radians per second (convert RPM with `RPM.of(x).in(RadiansPerSecond)`), and torque in newton meters, not inch pounds.
* **`IllegalArgumentException: Unknown motor for TalonFXS`.** Use a factory: see the warning in [Give it to the wrapper](#give-it-to-the-wrapper).

Now that the simulation matches the motor, tune your mechanism as its tutorial does: [Arm](../tutorials/arm/tune.md), [Elevator](../tutorials/elevator/tune.md) or [Shooter](../tutorials/shooter-flywheels/tune.md).
