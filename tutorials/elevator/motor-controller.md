# Step 1: The motor controller

{% hint style="info" %}
This page assumes a project with YAMS and REVLib installed. If you do not have one yet, start at [Create a project and install YAMS](../project-setup.md).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Did the arm tutorial?** This step is the same as [the arm's step 1](../arm/motor-controller.md), except:

* **The sprocket or drum** (part 2) is new. It tells YAMS how far the carriage moves for each turn, so that you can work in meters.
* **Linear units.** The motion profile, starting position and soft limits are in meters and meters per second, not degrees.
* **`ElevatorFeedforward`** replaces `ArmFeedforward`. Its `kG` is the same at every height, because gravity pulls the carriage straight down wherever it is.
* **Cascading elevators** divide the gearing by the number of stages (part 5).

Skim the parts you know and read those four.
{% endhint %}

A `SmartMotorController` is how YAMS talks to a motor controller. It takes three things:

1. **The vendor's motor controller object**, here a `SparkMax`.
2. **The motor** that is plugged into it, here one NEO.
3. **A `SmartMotorControllerConfig`** that says what the motor controller should do: its control mode, its PID and feedforward gains, its motion profile, the gearing between the motor and the sprocket, how far the carriage moves for each turn of the sprocket, where the carriage starts, and how far the closed loop may take it.

YAMS applies the config to the `SparkMax` for you, and uses the same config to build the simulation.

**In a hurry?** Jump to [the complete file](#the-complete-file), copy it, and change the values called out under **For your robot**. The numbered parts explain each piece in a sentence or two. You do not need to understand all of it to get moving: the pages under **Understanding** go deeper when you want them.
{% endhint %}

## Create the file

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Java, Commands v2" %}
Create `ElevatorSubsystem.java` in the `subsystems` folder, next to the template's `ExampleSubsystem.java`.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Java, Commands v3" %}
Create `ElevatorMechanism.java` in the `mechanisms` folder, next to the template's `ExampleMechanism.java`.

The config comes from `yams.commands3.config`, and it takes the `Mechanism` where Commands v2 passes the subsystem.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C++" %}
Create `ElevatorSubsystem.hpp` in `src/main/include/subsystems` and `ElevatorSubsystem.cpp` in `src/main/cpp/subsystems`.

YAMS keeps a pointer to the config and to the `SparkMax`, so in C++ both are members of the subsystem. The constructor fills in the config and then creates the `SmartMotorController`, which is why that one is a `std::optional`.

`WithFeedback` is the C++ name of `withClosedLoopController`, `WithMotorGearing` of `withGearing`, `WithLinearTrapezoidProfile` of the linear `withTrapezoidalProfile`, and `WithMeasurementLimits` of the linear `withSoftLimits`. The sprocket is described with `WithMechanismCircumference(pitch, teeth)` where Java uses `withDrumRadius(pitch, teeth)`.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## 1. Start the config

Everything the motor controller should do goes into one `SmartMotorControllerConfig`. Start it, and put it in closed loop mode so that it can hold a position.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Java, Commands v2" %}
{% code title="subsystems/ElevatorSubsystem.java" %}
```java
// What the motor controller should do: its control mode, gains, gearing and limits.
private final SmartMotorControllerConfig smcConfig = new SmartMotorControllerConfig(this)
    .withControlMode(ControlMode.CLOSED_LOOP)
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Java, Commands v3" %}
{% code title="mechanisms/ElevatorMechanism.java" %}
```java
// What the motor controller should do: its control mode, gains, gearing and limits.
private final SmartMotorControllerConfig smcConfig = new SmartMotorControllerConfig(this)
    .withControlMode(ControlMode.CLOSED_LOOP)
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C++" %}
{% code title="include/subsystems/ElevatorSubsystem.hpp" %}
```cpp
// What the motor controller should do. It is filled in by the constructor.
yams::motorcontrollers::SmartMotorControllerConfig m_smcConfig;
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="cpp/subsystems/ElevatorSubsystem.cpp" %}
```cpp
// What the motor controller should do: its control mode, gains, gearing and limits.
m_smcConfig
    .WithSubsystem(this)
    .WithClosedLoopMode()
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## 2. The sprocket or drum

An elevator has to know how far the carriage moves for each turn of the output shaft. Without it YAMS cannot turn rotations into a height.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/howto-mechanism-circumference.gif" alt="Animation of a 4 inch drum and a 22 tooth sprocket on 0.25 inch pitch chain, each turning two rotations. The drum moves its cable 12.57 inches per rotation, 25.13 inches in total. The sprocket moves its chain 5.50 inches per rotation, 11 inches in total."><figcaption><p>Each rotation of the mechanism moves it by one circumference.</p></figcaption></figure>

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Java, Commands v2" %}
{% code title="subsystems/ElevatorSubsystem.java" %}
```java
// How far the carriage moves for each turn of the output shaft:
// #25 chain has a 0.25 inch pitch, and the sprocket has 22 teeth,
// so one turn moves the chain pitch x teeth = 5.5 inches.
.withDrumRadius(Inches.of(0.25), 22)
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Java, Commands v3" %}
{% code title="mechanisms/ElevatorMechanism.java" %}
```java
// How far the carriage moves for each turn of the output shaft:
// #25 chain has a 0.25 inch pitch, and the sprocket has 22 teeth,
// so one turn moves the chain pitch x teeth = 5.5 inches.
.withDrumRadius(Inches.of(0.25), 22)
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C++" %}
{% code title="cpp/subsystems/ElevatorSubsystem.cpp" %}
```cpp
// How far the carriage moves for each turn of the output shaft:
// #25 chain has a 0.25 inch pitch, and the sprocket has 22 teeth,
// so one turn moves the chain pitch x teeth = 5.5 inches.
.WithMechanismCircumference(0.25_in, 22)
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

`withDrumRadius(pitch, teeth)` works the radius out from the chain for you: one turn of the sprocket moves the chain one pitch per tooth, 0.25 inch x 22 = 5.5 inches here.

**For your robot:** Use your own chain pitch and tooth count, or the radius of your drum:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Java, Commands v2" %}
```java
.withDrumRadius(Inches.of(0.25), 22)   // #25 chain (0.25 inch pitch), 22 tooth sprocket
.withDrumRadius(Inches.of(0.375), 16)  // #35 chain (0.375 inch pitch), 16 tooth sprocket
.withDrumRadius(Inches.of(0.875))      // a spool or drum with a 0.875 inch radius
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Java, Commands v3" %}
```java
.withDrumRadius(Inches.of(0.25), 22)   // #25 chain (0.25 inch pitch), 22 tooth sprocket
.withDrumRadius(Inches.of(0.375), 16)  // #35 chain (0.375 inch pitch), 16 tooth sprocket
.withDrumRadius(Inches.of(0.875))      // a spool or drum with a 0.875 inch radius
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C++" %}
```cpp
.WithMechanismCircumference(0.25_in, 22)   // #25 chain (0.25 inch pitch), 22 tooth sprocket
.WithMechanismCircumference(0.375_in, 16)  // #35 chain (0.375 inch pitch), 16 tooth sprocket
.WithMechanismRadius(0.875_in)             // a spool or drum with a 0.875 inch radius
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## 3. PID and feedforward

The PID gains correct the difference between where the elevator is and where you asked it to be. The feedforward supplies the voltage you already know it needs. The `Sim` options are used only in simulation, so the simulation can be tuned without touching the real robot's gains.

**Gravity on an elevator.** Gravity always pulls the carriage down with the same force, at the bottom, in the middle or at the top. So the motor needs the same voltage just to hold it still at any height. That voltage is `kG`, the middle number of `ElevatorFeedforward(kS, kG, kV)`. (An arm is different: its `kG` shrinks as it points up or down.)

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Java, Commands v2" %}
{% code title="subsystems/ElevatorSubsystem.java" %}
```java
// Feedback constants (PID), on the real robot and in simulation.
.withClosedLoopController(4, 0, 0)
.withSimClosedLoopController(4, 0, 0)

// Feedforward constants, on the real robot and in simulation.
.withFeedforward(new ElevatorFeedforward(0, 0, 0))
.withSimFeedforward(new ElevatorFeedforward(0, 0, 0))
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Java, Commands v3" %}
{% code title="mechanisms/ElevatorMechanism.java" %}
```java
// Feedback constants (PID), on the real robot and in simulation.
.withClosedLoopController(4, 0, 0)
.withSimClosedLoopController(4, 0, 0)

// Feedforward constants, on the real robot and in simulation.
.withFeedforward(new ElevatorFeedforward(0, 0, 0))
.withSimFeedforward(new ElevatorFeedforward(0, 0, 0))
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C++" %}
{% code title="cpp/subsystems/ElevatorSubsystem.cpp" %}
```cpp
// Feedback constants (PID), on the real robot and in simulation.
.WithFeedback(4, 0, 0)
.WithSimClosedLoopController(4, 0, 0)

// Feedforward constants (kS, kG and kV), on the real robot and in simulation.
.WithFeedforward(wpi::math::ElevatorFeedforward{
    0_V, 0_V, wpi::units::unit_t<wpi::math::ElevatorFeedforward::kv_unit>{0}})
.WithSimFeedforward(wpi::math::ElevatorFeedforward{
    0_V, 0_V, wpi::units::unit_t<wpi::math::ElevatorFeedforward::kv_unit>{0}})
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

These gains are **placeholders**. `kP` of 4 is 4 volts for each meter of error, and every feedforward gain is 0.

**What to expect with them:** the elevator moves, but with `kG` at 0 only `kP` holds the carriage up. `kP` only pushes when the carriage is below its setpoint, so the carriage sags: in simulation it settles roughly 15 cm below each setpoint. That is expected. You find `kG` in [Step 5: Tune it](tune.md), and the sag goes away.

**For your robot:** Leave these numbers for now, and tune them in step 5.

## 4. Motion profile

The profile caps how fast the elevator may move and accelerate on its way to a setpoint, so that it glides there instead of lunging.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Java, Commands v2" %}
{% code title="subsystems/ElevatorSubsystem.java" %}
```java
// The fastest the closed loop is allowed to move and accelerate the carriage.
.withTrapezoidalProfile(MetersPerSecond.of(0.5), MetersPerSecondPerSecond.of(0.5))
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Java, Commands v3" %}
{% code title="mechanisms/ElevatorMechanism.java" %}
```java
// The fastest the closed loop is allowed to move and accelerate the carriage.
.withTrapezoidalProfile(MetersPerSecond.of(0.5), MetersPerSecondPerSecond.of(0.5))
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C++" %}
{% code title="cpp/subsystems/ElevatorSubsystem.cpp" %}
```cpp
// The fastest the closed loop is allowed to move and accelerate the carriage.
.WithLinearTrapezoidProfile(0.5_mps, 0.5_mps_sq)
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**For your robot:** Start slow. Raise the two numbers once the mechanism moves safely.

## 5. Gearing

The gearing tells YAMS how many turns of the motor make one turn of the sprocket.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/tutorial-gearing.gif" alt="Animation of a motor rotor turning 12 times while the mechanism it drives through a 3 to 1 stage and a 4 to 1 stage, 12 to 1 in total, turns once. Counters show the motor rotations and the mechanism rotations and angle."><figcaption><p>With 12:1 gearing, twelve rotations of the motor are one rotation of the mechanism.</p></figcaption></figure>

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Java, Commands v2" %}
{% code title="subsystems/ElevatorSubsystem.java" %}
```java
// Gearing from the motor rotor to the sprocket: a 3:1 stage and a 4:1 stage, 12:1 in total.
.withGearing(new MechanismGearing(GearBox.fromReductionStages(3, 4)))
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Java, Commands v3" %}
{% code title="mechanisms/ElevatorMechanism.java" %}
```java
// Gearing from the motor rotor to the sprocket: a 3:1 stage and a 4:1 stage, 12:1 in total.
.withGearing(new MechanismGearing(GearBox.fromReductionStages(3, 4)))
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C++" %}
{% code title="cpp/subsystems/ElevatorSubsystem.cpp" %}
```cpp
// Gearing from the motor rotor to the sprocket: a 3:1 stage and a 4:1 stage, 12:1 in total.
.WithMotorGearing(MechanismGearing{GearBox::FromReductionStages({3.0, 4.0})})
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**For your robot:** List your gearbox stages in order, from the motor outward. `3, 4` here is a 3:1 stage followed by a 4:1 stage.

**Cascading elevator?** In a cascading elevator each stage rides on the one below, so the top carriage moves faster than the chain. Add the number of stages right **after** `withGearing`. It divides the gearing that is already set, so put before `withGearing` it would be overwritten:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Java" %}
```java
.withGearing(new MechanismGearing(GearBox.fromReductionStages(3, 4)))
// A two stage cascading elevator: divides the 12:1 gearing above by 2.
.withCascadingElevatorStages(2)
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C++" %}
```cpp
.WithMotorGearing(MechanismGearing{GearBox::FromReductionStages({3.0, 4.0})})
// A two stage cascading elevator: divides the 12:1 gearing above by 2.
.WithCascadingElevatorStages(2)
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Skip this for a continuous elevator, like the one in this tutorial.

## 6. Direction, idle mode and current limit

Which way is positive, what the motor does when it is given no power, and the most current it may draw.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Java, Commands v2" %}
{% code title="subsystems/ElevatorSubsystem.java" %}
```java
.withMotorInverted(false)
.withZeroPower(MotorMode.BRAKE)
.withStatorCurrentLimit(Amps.of(40))
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Java, Commands v3" %}
{% code title="mechanisms/ElevatorMechanism.java" %}
```java
.withMotorInverted(false)
.withZeroPower(MotorMode.BRAKE)
.withStatorCurrentLimit(Amps.of(40))
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C++" %}
{% code title="cpp/subsystems/ElevatorSubsystem.cpp" %}
```cpp
.WithMotorInverted(false)
.WithZeroPower(Cfg::MotorMode::BRAKE)
.WithStatorCurrentLimit(40_A)
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**For your robot:** Flip the inversion if a positive output moves your elevator the wrong way. Keep the current limit within what your wiring and breaker allow.

## 7. Starting position and soft limits

The starting position is where the elevator is when the robot turns on. The soft limits are as far as the closed loop is allowed to take it.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/smc-soft-limits.png" alt="A bar showing a mechanism's travel between two hard stops, with a lower and an upper soft limit a little inside them. The mechanism may move between the soft limits. A setpoint asked for beyond the upper limit is moved back to the limit."><figcaption><p>Soft limits sit a little inside the hard stops.</p></figcaption></figure>

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Java, Commands v2" %}
{% code title="subsystems/ElevatorSubsystem.java" %}
```java
// Where the carriage is when the robot turns on.
.withStartingPosition(Meters.of(0))
// The closed loop will not take the carriage past these heights.
.withSoftLimits(Meters.of(0), Meters.of(2))
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Java, Commands v3" %}
{% code title="mechanisms/ElevatorMechanism.java" %}
```java
// Where the carriage is when the robot turns on.
.withStartingPosition(Meters.of(0))
// The closed loop will not take the carriage past these heights.
.withSoftLimits(Meters.of(0), Meters.of(2))
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C++" %}
{% code title="cpp/subsystems/ElevatorSubsystem.cpp" %}
```cpp
// Where the carriage is when the robot turns on.
.WithStartingPosition(0_m)
// The closed loop will not take the carriage past these heights.
.WithMeasurementLimits(0_m, 2_m)
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Both take meters, so they need the sprocket from part 2 first: YAMS uses its circumference to turn meters into rotations. That is why `withDrumRadius` comes earlier in the config. In C++, `WithStartingPosition(meters)` and `WithMeasurementLimits` throw an error if `WithMechanismCircumference` has not been called yet, and in Java `withStartingPosition(meters)` and `withSoftLimits(meters)` do the same without `withDrumRadius`.

The lower soft limit here is 0 m, the same as the bottom hard stop and the starting height. That is on purpose: the carriage rests on the bottom stop, and the default command parks it there, so the closed loop never asks for a height below it.

**For your robot:** Set the starting position to where your carriage really rests when the robot turns on, and the upper soft limit a little below the top hard stop. If your carriage pushes into the bottom stop when it parks, raise the lower soft limit and the parking height a little, such as 0.02 m.

## 8. Telemetry

The name the motor gets on your dashboard, and how much it publishes. `HIGH` publishes everything, which is what you want while tuning.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Java, Commands v2" %}
{% code title="subsystems/ElevatorSubsystem.java" %}
```java
// Telemetry name and how much to publish.
.withTelemetry("ElevatorMotor", TelemetryVerbosity.HIGH);
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Java, Commands v3" %}
{% code title="mechanisms/ElevatorMechanism.java" %}
```java
// Telemetry name and how much to publish.
.withTelemetry("ElevatorMotor", TelemetryVerbosity.HIGH);
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C++" %}
{% code title="cpp/subsystems/ElevatorSubsystem.cpp" %}
```cpp
// Telemetry name and how much to publish.
.WithTelemetry("ElevatorMotor", Cfg::TelemetryVerbosity::HIGH);
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Want the details? [Telemetry](../../understanding/telemetry.md)

## 9. The motor controller object

This is the vendor's own object, exactly as you would create it without YAMS.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Java, Commands v2" %}
{% code title="subsystems/ElevatorSubsystem.java" %}
```java
// The vendor motor controller object: a SPARK MAX with CAN ID 4.
private final SparkMax spark = new SparkMax(CANPort.CAN_S0, 4, MotorType.kBrushless);
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Java, Commands v3" %}
{% code title="mechanisms/ElevatorMechanism.java" %}
```java
// The vendor motor controller object: a SPARK MAX with CAN ID 4.
private final SparkMax spark = new SparkMax(CANPort.CAN_S0, 4, MotorType.kBrushless);
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C++" %}
{% code title="include/subsystems/ElevatorSubsystem.hpp" %}
```cpp
// The vendor motor controller object: a SPARK MAX with CAN ID 4.
rev::spark::SparkMax m_spark{wpi::CANPort::CAN_S0, 4, rev::spark::SparkMax::MotorType::kBrushless};
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**For your robot:** Change the CAN ID to yours. Using a different motor controller? See the [feature matrix](../../details/editor/feature-matrix.md) for the wrapper that goes with it.

## 10. The SmartMotorController

The wrapper brings the three together: the motor controller object, the motor plugged into it, and the config.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Java, Commands v2" %}
{% code title="subsystems/ElevatorSubsystem.java" %}
```java
// The SmartMotorController applies the config to the SPARK MAX, which drives one NEO.
private final SmartMotorController motor = new SparkWrapper(spark, DCMotor.getNEO(1), smcConfig);
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Java, Commands v3" %}
{% code title="mechanisms/ElevatorMechanism.java" %}
```java
// The SmartMotorController applies the config to the SPARK MAX, which drives one NEO.
private final SmartMotorController motor = new SparkWrapper(spark, DCMotor.getNEO(1), smcConfig);
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C++" %}
{% code title="include/subsystems/ElevatorSubsystem.hpp" %}
```cpp
// The SmartMotorController, created in the constructor once the config is ready.
std::optional<yams::motorcontrollers::local::SparkWrapper> m_motor;
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="cpp/subsystems/ElevatorSubsystem.cpp" %}
```cpp
// The SmartMotorController applies the config to the SPARK MAX, which drives one NEO.
m_motor.emplace(&m_spark, wpi::math::DCMotor::NEO(1), &m_smcConfig);
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**For your robot:** Change the motor to the kind and the number of motors you have.

## Read more

Every option used here has its own section in the `SmartMotorControllerConfig` pages:

* [Motor basics](../../details/editor/config/motor-basics.md): control mode, inversion, what the motor does at zero power
* [Gearing and units](../../details/editor/config/gearing-and-units.md): gearing, and how rotations become distance
* [Closed loop control](../../details/editor/config/closed-loop-control.md), [Feedforward](../../details/editor/config/feedforward.md) and [Motion profiles](../../details/editor/config/motion-profiles.md)
* [Limits and protection](../../details/editor/config/limits-and-protection.md): soft limits and current limits
* [Simulation](../../details/editor/config/simulation.md): the simulation only gains

The PID and feedforward numbers on this page are a place to start, not tuned values. You tune them in [Step 5: Tune it](tune.md).

## Check it

Open the command palette with <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> and run **WPILib: Build Robot Code**. It should build. Nothing moves yet, because nothing tells the motor what to do.

* **`SparkMax` or `SparkWrapper` cannot be found:** REVLib is not installed. See [Install your motor controller's library](../project-setup.md#install-your-motor-controllers-library).
* **`SmartMotorControllerConfig` cannot be found:** YAMS is not installed, or the import is from the other command framework (`yams.commands2` or `yams.commands3`).
