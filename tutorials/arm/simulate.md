description: Run the arm in simulation and drive it with a controller.

# Step 4: Simulate it

The code from the first three steps runs on your computer exactly as it will on the robot. YAMS simulates the motor, the gearing and the arm, so the closed loop, the limits and the commands all behave the way they will on the real mechanism.

## Start the simulation

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Java, Commands v2" %}
Open the command palette with <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> and run **WPILib: Simulate Robot Code**. If you are asked which extensions to run, tick **Sim GUI**.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Java, Commands v3" %}
Open the command palette with <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> and run **WPILib: Simulate Robot Code**. If you are asked which extensions to run, tick **Sim GUI**.

The buttons are bound in the `ExampleTeleop` op mode, so that is the op mode to run when you enable.

If the simulated mechanism never moves, check that `Robot.java` has a `simulationInit()` that calls `startSimulation(...)` for the mechanism.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="C++" %}
Open the command palette with <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> and run **WPILib: Simulate Robot Code**. If you are asked which extensions to run, tick **Sim GUI**.

The first C++ build compiles the whole project, so it takes a few minutes. Later builds are much faster.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Drive it

1. Connect a controller to your computer, then drag it from **System Joysticks** to **Joystick\[0]**.
2. Open the simulated mechanism with **NetworkTables -> Mechanisms -> Arm -> mechanism**. It is named after the `withTelemetry("Arm", ...)` on the `ArmConfig`.

3. Resize **Arm/mechanism** to your liking.
4. Commands v3: pick the `ExampleTeleop` op mode first. Then press **Teleoperated** in **Robot State**. The controller now drives the simulated arm just as it would the real one.

No controller? The Sim GUI can use the keyboard as a joystick: drag **Keyboard 0** to **Joystick\[0]**.

## What you should see

* Before you enable, the arm is drawn at -5 degrees, its starting position.
* When you enable, the default command takes it up to 0 degrees, level.
* Holding **A** takes it to -5 degrees, and holding **B** to 15 degrees. Let go, and it goes back to 0 degrees.
* Holding **X** drives it up, and **Y** drives it down, until the soft limits stop it.
* It sits a little below each setpoint. That is the placeholder gains: `kG` is 0, so nothing holds the arm up against gravity except `kP`. The next step fixes it.

## If it did not work

* **The arm is not in the NetworkTables menu.** Look under **Mechanisms**, not **SmartDashboard**.
* **The arm does not move.** Check the robot is enabled in **Teleoperated** and the controller is on **Joystick\[0]**. Commands v3: check `Robot.simulationInit()` starts the arm's simulation.
* **The code stops with an error when the simulation starts.** Read the first error. YAMS names the setting that is missing, such as a starting position outside the hard limits.
